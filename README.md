# Simple State Machine

Extremely simple toy example of a state machine. Mimics the [ROSFlight State Manager](https://docs.rosflight.org/v1.3/developer-guide/code-architecture/#state-manager) with actions provided via user keyboard input.

Simply `cargo build` and run the resulting target. Actions are listed in the source code.
